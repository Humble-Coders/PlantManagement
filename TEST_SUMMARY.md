## Build Status
✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**
- All Kotlin files compiled without errors
- Only deprecation warnings (existing, not related to our changes)
- JVM tests passed

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Login as Accountant (USER role)**
   - Sign in with a user account that has USER role

2. **Navigate to Cash Report Module**
   - Go to Cash Report section from the menu

3. **Test Transfer Button**
   - Verify "Transfer" button is visible
   - Click on Transfer button
   - Enter an amount and select transfer type (Add/Deduct)
   - Verify balance transfer completes successfully

4. **Test Transfer History**
   - Click on "History" button
   - Verify transfer history dialog opens
   - Verify you can see all transfer records

5. **Verify Shared Balance Card**
   - Check that the User Balance Card displays correctly
   - Verify the help text mentions transfers

### Expected Behavior:
✅ Accountants (USER role) should now have access to Transfer and History buttons
✅ Accountants can perform balance transfers (add/deduct)
✅ Accountants can view transfer history
✅ Help text correctly reflects the new permissions

## Files Modified
1. `composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin/com/humblecoders/plantmanagement/ui/CashReportsScreen.kt`
2. `composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin/com/humblecoders/plantmanagement/viewmodels/UserBalanceViewModel.kt`

## Notes
- The backend (UserBalanceRepository) already supported these operations
- Only UI and ViewModel permission checks were blocking accountant access
- All existing functionality for ADMIN users remains intact
